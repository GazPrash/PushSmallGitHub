# PushSmall

## Overview

This simple Bash shell script automates the process of adding files larger than a specified size to your `.gitignore` file. By doing so, these large files will be excluded from your commits to GitHub, helping to manage your repository size.

## How It Works

The script scans the current directory for files exceeding a specified size threshold and automatically appends their names to the `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Bash installed on your system.

### Running the Script

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GazPrash/PushSmallGitHub.git
